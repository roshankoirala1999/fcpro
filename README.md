Of course. Here is a user guide on how to use the File Toolbox application.

Getting Started
When you first open the app, you will see two options:

File Converter: For changing file types, merging files, and performing edits.

File Compressor: For reducing the file size of a single image or PDF.

Click on the tool you wish to use.

Upload Files:

Once uploaded, you will see a preview card for each file.

Reorder: Click and drag the file cards to change their order for merging.

Preview: Click the Preview button on any card to see a larger view of the file.

Edit:

For images, click Edit to open an editor where you can rotate the image. Click Save Changes to keep them.

For PDFs, click Edit Pages to open an editor where you can reorder or rotate individual pages. Click Save Changes to apply them.

Delete: Click the red trash can icon to remove a file from your list.

Choose Output Options:

Output Format: Select your desired final format (PNG, JPEG, WEBP, or PDF) from the dropdown menu.

Conversion Mode (for multiple files):

The results will appear below. Click the Download button next to each result to save it to your device.

Upload a File:

Click the "Click to upload a single file" box to select one PDF, JPG, or PNG file.

Adjust Compression:

Once uploaded, you will see the file's details and a Compression Quality slider.

Move the slider to adjust the quality (1% is lowest quality/smallest size, 100% is highest quality/largest size).

As you move the slider, watch the Original and Projected size indicators to see an estimate of the final file size.

Compress and Download:

When you are happy with the projected size, click the Compress File button.

A result card will appear with a Download button. Click it to save your compressed file. The new file will be named filename_compressedbyRK.ext.

Navigation
At any point, you can click the "‚Üê Back to Tool Selection" link at the top of either tool's view to return to the main menu. This will reset the current tool.
